                    coverage, and the claims settlement process. You have the right to an easy-to-understand explanation
                    of how insurance works and how it will meet your needs. You also have a right to know how insurers
                    calculate price based on relevant facts. Under normal circumstances, insurers will advise an
                    insurance customer or the customer's intermediary of changes to, or the cancellation of a policy
                    within a reasonable prescribed period prior to the expiration of the policy, if the customer

                    prescribed, which could vary by province, but is usually 45 days prior to expiry of the policy.

                <p style="font-family: Libre Franklin;">But it was the cooking that occurred in her friends' homes that
                    fascinated Lillian — the aromas that started calling to her just when she had to go home in the
                    evening. Some smells were sharp, an olfactory clatter of heels across a hardwood floor. Others felt
                    like the warmth in the air at the far end of summer. Lillian watched as the scent of melting cheese
                    brought children languidly from their rooms, saw how garlic made them talkative, jokes expanding
                    into stories of their days. Lillian thought it odd that not all mothers seemed to see it — Sarah's
                    mother, for instance, always cooked curry when she was fighting with her teenage daughter, its smell
                    rocketing through the house like a challenge. But Lillian soon realized that many people did not
                    comprehend the language of smells that to Lillian was as obvi-ous as a billboard.

                    Perhaps, Lillian thought, smells were for her what printed words were for others, something alive
                    that grew and changed. Not just the smell of rosemary in the garden, but the scent on her hands
                    after she had picked some for Elizabeth's mother, the aroma mingling with the heavy smell of chicken
                    fat and garlic in the oven, the after-scent on the couch cushions the next day. The way, ever after,
                    Elizabeth was always part of rosemary for Lillian, how Elizabeth's round face had crinkled up into
                    laughter when Lillian had pushed the small, spiky branch near her nose

                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans';">Encouraged, he walked westward, till he struck a deer trail which
                    he then began to follow. The trail meandered roughly along the same course as the river, now and
                    then coming in sight of it, through a gap in the trees. There were vast clearings with corn just
                    beginning to tassel, south of his way, in the direction of Brandenburg. In the end he might gain the
                    Mississippi again, but that would be days, on his bare feet. And there were soldiers beginning to
                    move in these parts, both the gray and the blue. When war became general he could make his own way,
                    but this circling suspicion was hard for him to navigate.

                    He began to know that he was being watched, by nothing human though, he thought. He stopped moving,
                    hand on the grip of his knife, and looked, barely breathing, only his eyeballs moving. A doe, a big
                    one, between the river and the trail. Melting brown eyes turned on him through a cluster of black
                    oak and maple leaves and the pale slender leaves of the cane. When he dropped his hip to free the
                    knife she was up and away, the white tail flashing.

            <div id="lit3-Rubik" style="display: none; flex-direction: column;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Rubik';">At home in Ballyroan, in the single-story cottage that stood beside the
                    sea, in the bed she shared with her older sister, eight-year-old Greta Cahill woke before dawn to a
                    sound that was not the ocean, was not the animals bawling into the wind, was not a slammed gate, a
                    clanging cowbell, or the rain beating on the gable. The sound was different, it was a first, and to
                    hear it better Greta pushed the layers of blankets away from her shoulders and sat up.
                    "You're letting in the cold," Johanna said into the dark without whispering, and tugged at the
                    blankets Greta had pushed away. As they struggled, a faint whiff of salmon stopped Greta's hands.
                    She had forgotten that part of last night's catch was lined up on a shallow tray and resting in the
                    emptied top drawer of the dresser she and Johanna shared. Greta pictured the six flat bodies in a
                    neat row-tails to the back, heads to the front, all split along the backbone and buried in salt. The
                    smell was barely noticeable so far, but Greta knew that in a few more hours the delicate tang of the
                    drying fish would be like an itch inside her nose that could not be scratched. The salt would pull
                    the water from the salmon's river-logged bodies, and it would be Johanna's job to drain the brine
                    with Greta looking on and their mother standing behind saying, "Are you watching, Greta? Are you
                    seeing how your sister does it?"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="lit4-WorkSans" style="display: none; flex-direction: column;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';">Every morning, Claudia entered the building on West Thirteenth
                    Street, rode the elevator up, and opened the front door of apartment 6F. She could immediately sense
                    whether Betsy wanted to chat or be left alone; whether James was looking to play with the children
                    or wanted them out of his hair. Rarely did Claudia have a discussion about the children's
                    development or behavior, even if she was worried about something. She simply felt her way through
                    the changes, taking stock of the vibe in the apartment and acting accordingly.

                    This kind of familiarity took time to develop. Every family was different, and each time Claudia or
                    her friends started a new job, there was another set of family rules to adapt to. There were mothers
                    who expected a perfectly neat house when they walked in the door-toys put away, dishes washed and in
                    the cabinets-and then there were mothers who eyed their living rooms suspiciously if books and
                    blocks and trains weren't scattered around, tensing up at the thought that their nanny might not
                    have been playing with their child that day. Some mothers wanted their children bathed while others
                    were territorial about the task. Some mothers gave instructions about food and naps and outfits to
                    be worn while others expected their nannies to take the initiative. Claudia was way past the
                    breaking-in stage with the Halls, and if she was ever frustrated at work, she talked herself out of
                    it. She could not leave this family and start all over again with another. It was just too hard.
