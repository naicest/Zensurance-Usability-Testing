                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans';">Product Liability Insurance is recommended for anyone who sells,
                    manufactures, or distributes a product, including food. It is beneficial to online retailers, as
                    well as those operating a brick-and-mortar location. If you are a member of a distribution chain,
                    ensure all suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors are adequately insured. Please discuss with
                    your broker whether or not you need to add them to your policy. Conversely, make sure you are
                    included as an additional insured on their policies, as you can be held responsible for product
                    liability on their end, too. If you import or export products outside of North America, verify that
                    the products are compliant with industry standards and that all labels contain the required and
                    appropriate information. Product Liability Insurance does not cover service-related claims and only
                    covers third-party property damage or bodily injury caused by a product you sell, manufacture, or
                    distribute. Claims associated with failure to provide a service as advertised, negligence, or
                    misconduct are covered by Professional Liability Insurance, also known as Error and Omissions.

                <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';">On a day to day basis, it's likely that you're interacting with
                    many people - such as employees, clients, vendors and contractors, to name a few. Any one of them
                    could experience an accident or claim that your business caused them injury or loss, and bring a
                    lawsuit against you. General Liability Insurance is a business insurance policy that is applicable
                    to most contractors and business owners because it protects them. When a business has this type of
                    insurance policy, they're covered when it comes to claims of bodily injury, associated medical costs
                    and damage to property that occurred as a result of your business operations. It also covers legal
                    defense costs, along with settlements and judgements should you be successfully sued. If you are a
                    tenant who causes damage to a property that you rent (like, for example, a fire), that's another
                    situation where under a General Liability Insurance policy, you'd be covered. Lastly, these types of
                    policies cover claims of false or misleading advertising. That could include libel, slander or
                    copyright infringement.

                <p style="font-family: 'Lato';">But it was the cooking that occurred in her friends' homes that
                    fascinated Lillian — the aromas that started calling to her just when she had to go home in the
                    evening. Some smells were sharp, an olfactory clatter of heels across a hardwood floor. Others felt
                    like the warmth in the air at the far end of summer. Lillian watched as the scent of melting cheese
                    brought children languidly from their rooms, saw how garlic made them talkative, jokes expanding
                    into stories of their days. Lillian thought it odd that not all mothers seemed to see it — Sarah's
                    mother, for instance, always cooked curry when she was fighting with her teenage daughter, its smell
                    rocketing through the house like a challenge. But Lillian soon realized that many people did not
                    comprehend the language of smells that to Lillian was as obvious as a billboard.

                    Perhaps, Lillian thought, smells were for her what printed words were for others, something alive
                    that grew and changed. Not just the smell of rosemary in the garden, but the scent on her hands
                    after she had picked some for Elizabeth's mother, the aroma mingling with the heavy smell of chicken
                    fat and garlic in the oven, the after-scent on the couch cushions the next day. The way, ever after,
                    Elizabeth was always part of rosemary for Lillian, how Elizabeth's round face had crinkled up into
                    laughter when Lillian had pushed the small, spiky branch near her nose.

                    he then began to follow. The trail meandered roughly along the same course as the river, now and
                    then coming in sight of it, through a gap in the trees. There were vast clearings with corn just
                    beginning to tassel, south of his way, in the direction of Brandenburg. In the end he might gain the
                    Mississippi again, but that would be days, on his bare feet. And there were soldiers beginning to
                    move in these parts, both the gray and the blue. When war became general he could make his own way,
                    but this circling suspicion was hard for him to navigate.

                    He began to know that he was being watched, by nothing human though, he thought. He stopped moving,
                    hand on the grip of his knife, and looked, barely breathing, only his eyeballs moving. A doe, a big
                    one, between the river and the trail. Melting brown eyes turned on him through a cluster of black
                    oak and maple leaves and the pale slender leaves of the cane. When he dropped his hip to free the
                    knife she was up and away, the white tail flashing.

            <div id="lit3-WorkSans" style="display: none;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';">At home in Ballyroan, in the single-story cottage that stood beside
                    the
                    sea, in the bed she shared with her older sister, eight-year-old Greta Cahill woke before dawn to a
                    sound that was not the ocean, was not the animals bawling into the wind, was not a slammed gate, a
                    clanging cowbell, or the rain beating on the gable. The sound was different, it was a first, and to
                    hear it better Greta pushed the layers of blankets away from her shoulders and sat up.
                    "You're letting in the cold," Johanna said into the dark without whispering, and tugged at the
                    blankets Greta had pushed away. As they struggled, a faint whiff of salmon stopped Greta's hands.
                    She had forgotten that part of last night's catch was lined up on a shallow tray and resting in the
                    emptied top drawer of the dresser she and Johanna shared. Greta pictured the six flat bodies in a
                    neat row-tails to the back, heads to the front, all split along the backbone and buried in salt. The
                    smell was barely noticeable so far, but Greta knew that in a few more hours the delicate tang of the
                    drying fish would be like an itch inside her nose that could not be scratched. The salt would pull
                    the water from the salmon's river-logged bodies, and it would be Johanna's job to drain the brine
                    with Greta looking on and their mother standing behind saying, "Are you watching, Greta? Are you
                    seeing how your sister does it?"
