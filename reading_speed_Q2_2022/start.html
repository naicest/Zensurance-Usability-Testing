                <p id="paragraph1" style="font-family: Georgia;">Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on
                    advanced technological systems. For example,
                    space vehicles and high-altitude aircraft rely on sophisticated, yet delicate, computer systems both
                    for safety
                    and for navigation. Global communications depend on high-frequency (or HF), very high frequency (or
                    VHF), and
                    ultra high frequency (or UHF) radio signals. Power distribution relies on an interconnected network
                    of lines,
                    transformers, computers, and other devices. As a result, we need to be aware of the potential
                    effects of
                    geomagnetic storms on their ability to function.
                    Geomagnetic storms occur when a mass of plasma is ejected from the Sun and strikes the Earth and its
                    surroundings. This plasma "bubble" travels away from the Sun at about two million miles per hour,
                    and follows
                    the three-dimensional spiral pattern of the Sun's magnetic field. It can reach Earth in about 40
                    hours.
